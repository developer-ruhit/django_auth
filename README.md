# django_auth

Hi,

I had created this project a long back while learning Django....but uploaded recently in github......

The project includes the following views:

  Account Registration - with Email Verification,
  Account Login,
  Account Logout,
  Account LogAllOut,
  Account Detail,
  Account Update,
  Account Delete,
  
Model Detail:
  The project uses Django's AbstractUser with an image field and email field as unique and required field
  
Authentication :
  django-rest-knox is used for authentication
